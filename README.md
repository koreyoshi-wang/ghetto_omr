Development goes like this:
IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
all images passed to functions in img_func has to be grayscale
--------------

1) write everything important in function files
1b) functions that dont really belong like shape detector(which is a sub function) use a new file

2) test implementation by running the function in the test.py
2b) or create any other test file that you like also can

what if i need to use the same function in two instances
like sing shape detector for MCQ and also for numerical

different file, thats why i got this shape file

test file is for implementing the functions, so call functions there
